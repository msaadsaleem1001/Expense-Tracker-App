The Personal Expense Tracker is a mobile application developed using Flutter. It serves as a tool to help users manage their finances by tracking their expenses efficiently. The application showcases expertise in Clean Architecture, SQflite, ThemeMode, state management, UI/UX design, local notifications, and unit testing.

## Features

## Note

This app can run on both IOS and Android but I don't have #Macbook that's why some native side permissions of IOS have not been handled yet. You can do minor fixes for IOS on your own.
