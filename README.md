## About

The Personal Expense Tracker is a mobile application developed using Flutter. It serves as a tool to help users manage their finances by tracking their expenses efficiently. The application showcases expertise in Clean Architecture, SQflite, ThemeMode, state management, UI/UX design, local notifications, and unit testing.

## Features

- **Clean Architecture**: The application is structured using Clean Architecture principles(MVVM), making it modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.
- **State Management**: Utilizes advanced state management (Bloc) techniques to efficiently manage the application's state and ensure a smooth user experience.
- **UI/UX Design**: Features a clean and intuitive user interface designed to provide a seamless experience for users while interacting with the application.
- **Local Notifications**: Incorporates local notifications to remind users of pending expenses or upcoming payments, helping them stay organized and on top of their finances.
- **Unit Testing**: Implements comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application's codebase.

## Note

This app can run on both IOS and Android but I don't have #Macbook that's why some native side permissions of IOS have not been handled yet. You can do minor fixes for IOS on your own.
